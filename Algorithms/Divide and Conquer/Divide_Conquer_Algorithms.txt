### Brute Force Algorithms
If there is an array of 1000 elements and you search through every element looking for a specific way, this would be classified as a Brute Force Algorithm.
Which delivers a time complexity of O(n) - linear

### Recursive Algorithms
To find a number in a sorted array you can use the Binary Search method.
Binary Search method grabs the middle element and divides the array into two sub arrays.
It uses the middle element as a comparison to the specific element you are searching for, if its greater than middle element it will
look at the greater subarray and select the middle element as the new comparer, same applies if specific searched element is lesser. It keeps
doing this until specific searched element is found.
Often delivers a time complexity of O(log n) - O(n log n)

## Three kinds of natures to divide and conquer behavior
# Decrease - and - conquer
Breaking the problem into a smaller one until the solution is trivial

# Divide - and - conquer
Dividing the problem into subproblems that can be dealt more easily

# Transform - and - conquer
Modifying the problem to a more amenable form to a particular solution




### Transform and conquer
It has three varients

# Instance Simplification
Transform to a simpler or more convenient
instance of the same problem

# Representation Change
t remains the same instance, but in a
different representation

# Problem Reduction
Transform to an instance of a different
problem for which a solution is already
available
