Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 child nodes, i.e., left and right or no children
● Complete Binary Tree: All levels, except possibly the last, are filled, and all nodes are as left
as possible
● Perfect Binary Tree: All nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same
level
● Balanced Binary Tree: The heights of any node’s left and right subtrees differ by at most one
● Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree in which: (1)The left subtree of a node contains only
nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key. (2) The right subtree of a node contains only
nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. (3) The left and right subtree each must also be
a binary search tree.

### AVL trees
Each insertion (or deletion) may require balancing
- called rotation
○ Simple rotation
■ Left rotation or Right rotation
● With or without children
○ Double rotation
■ Right-left rotation or Left-right rotation
● With or without children
