When you create a variable it has to be stored somewhere in your computer.

Memory: Foundational layer of computing where all data is stored. Bounded canvas with memory slots.

Bit: Binary digit, 0 and 1, any data stored in a computer is stored as bits

Byte: group of 8 bits, 00000101, 

Data stored in in memory is stored as bytes and by extension bits. So your local variable that you created
 earlier is stored as bits.


Bytes in memory can "point" to other bytes in memory, so as to store
    references to other data.

    
The amount of memory that a machine has is bounded, making it valuable to
    limit how much memory an algorithm takes up.
  


Accessing a byte or a fixed number of bytes (like 4 bytes or 8 bytes in the
    case of 32-bit and 64-bit integers) is an elementary
    operation, which can be loosely treated as a single unit of operational
    work.
