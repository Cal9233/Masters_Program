### Importance of Documentation

# Documentaion is used to understand the logic behind a running code, couple reasons to follow it:

● Fix software bug (Maintenaince issue)
● To change the software functionality (Maintenaince issue)
● Decide using a software module (reuse issue)

While maintenance issues relate to software readability, reuse issues relate to
software specification
● Software readability deal with software as open code
● Software specification deal with software as encapsulated code

Documentaion provides good practices for other aspects and reinenforces readability of:
● Classes - purposes, methods, interfaces, dependencies, limitations
● Methods - function, mutator/accessor, input and output parameters
● Variables - type, meaning, usage, invariants
● Constants - type, meaning, usage, impact
● Functions - function, i/o parameters, dependencies, algorithm, limitations
● Modules - constituents, purpose, dependencies
● Packages - constituents, purpose, dependencies


Depending on the language the needs for documentation may vary
● Python is an untyped language, Java and C++ are typed languages
● Python and C++ may use Classes and Functions, in Java everything is a class and all execution is made through class' methods

Documentation is usually a tedious (repetitive) process that requires a strict discipline to keep the same standards
● This is unsuitable for humans, but easier to automate
○ Software documentation generators - based on a markup language
■ normally strongly attached to a language or Integrated
Development Environment, a.k.a. editor/debugger/runner+documenter

## Python Doc
Python language define some standards for developing documentation, it includes best practices for coding python and
automatic generation of documentation.

Basic use of PyDoc is done using command "  pydoc3 -b  "

Using pydoc with a browser python -m pydoc -b (on a mac : pydoc3 -b)
It opens a webpage on your local host with links to the documentation of the modules split in sections.
It is also included other documentations search options, as search button, keywords, etc

Python programs can be documented at several levels using docstrings
● Module/Package
○ A multiline comment with triple quotation at the first line of the file
● Classes
○ A multiline comment with triple quotation at the first line after the declaration of the class
● Functions and methods
○ A multiline comment with triple quotation at the first line after the definition of the function/method

You can also view documentation of a library by running "python pydoc -m <name_of_library>" in the terminal
