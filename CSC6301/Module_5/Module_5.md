## ✅ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

**Definition:**  
The SDLC is the process used to plan, develop, test, and maintain software.  
→ **Easier:** It's the steps you follow to build and take care of software.

### 🛠️ Main Steps of SDLC:

1. **Planning and Requirements Definition**  
   Defines goals, timeline, needed resources (people, tech), and what the software must do.  
   → **Easier:** Figure out what needs to be built, by who, and when.

2. **Design & Prototyping and Coding**  
   Design: Plan how software will work (architecture, interface, etc.).  
   Prototyping: Make a sample or test version.  
   Coding: Write the actual code.  
   → **Easier:** Plan the look and make a small sample before building it for real.

3. **Testing and Deployment**  
   Test the software to fix bugs. Then release it for use.  
   → **Easier:** Check for problems and share the final version.

4. **Operations and Maintenance**  
   Ongoing support, fixing bugs, updating software.  
   → **Easier:** Take care of the software after it’s released.

## 🔁 SDLC Strategies

**Definition:**  
Different ways to follow the SDLC steps depending on the project needs.  
→ **Easier:** Pick a style or method to do the steps based on what works best.

### Popular Strategies:

- **Waterfall**:  
  Each step happens one after the other. Simple but not flexible.  
  → **Easier:** Do everything in order—no going back.

- **V-Model**:  
  Like Waterfall, but with testing after each step.  
  → **Easier:** Test as you go.

- **Iterative**:  
  Keep improving the project in small steps.  
  → **Easier:** Build a little, improve, repeat.

- **Incremental**:  
  Build it piece by piece.  
  → **Easier:** Make one part, then the next.

- **Spiral**:  
  Keep going through all the steps again and again with full planning each time.  
  → **Easier:** Go through the steps in a loop.

- **Lean**:  
  Only do what's necessary—cut out extras.  
  → **Easier:** Don’t waste time or effort.

- **Agile**:  
  Do small changes fast, allow mistakes early.  
  → **Easier:** Try and fix things quickly.

- **DevOps**:  
  Combines development and operations, very fast-paced.  
  → **Easier:** Build and manage software together super quickly.

## 🔨 Design Patterns Overview

### 🔷 Creational Patterns  
Used for creating objects.  
→ **Easier:** Helps make things the right way.

- Singleton  
- Factory  
- Abstract Factory  
- Builder  
- Prototype

### 🔷 Structural Patterns  
Used for class and object composition.  
→ **Easier:** Helps connect parts of the software.

- Adapter  
- Bridge  
- Composite  
- Decorator  
- Facade  
- Flyweight  
- Proxy

#### ➕ Decorator Pattern  
Adds new features to objects without changing their original class.  
→ **Easier:** Add new powers to something without breaking it.

### 🔷 Behavioral Patterns  
Focus on communication between objects.  
→ **Easier:** Helps different parts talk to each other.

- Observer  
- State  
- Command  
- Chain of Responsibility  
- Interpreter  
- Iterator  
- Mediator  
- Memento  
- Visitor

#### 👀 Observer Pattern  
One object changes, and all watchers get notified.  
→ **Easier:** If something changes, let others know.

#### 🚦 State Pattern  
Object changes how it behaves when its internal state changes.  
→ **Easier:** It acts differently depending on what state it's in.
