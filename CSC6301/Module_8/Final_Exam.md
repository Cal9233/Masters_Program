Software Design & Documentation

üìö WEEK 1: Python Documentation with pydoc
Core Concepts to Master

1. The Importance of Documentation
   Why Documentation Matters:

Documentation is for humans, not computers
Essential for software maintenance and reuse
Helps with bug fixes, functionality changes, and code understanding
"Undocumented software is often useless"

Two Main Purposes:

Software Readability (maintenance) - understanding open code
Software Specification (reuse) - understanding encapsulated code

2. Python Docstrings
   What to Document:

Modules/Packages: First line of file with triple quotes
Classes: First line after class declaration
Functions/Methods: First line after function definition

Docstring Syntax:
pythondef my_function(param1, param2):
"""
Brief description of function.

    Longer description if needed.

    Args:
        param1: Description of first parameter
        param2: Description of second parameter

    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    return result

3. pydoc Tool Usage
   Reading Documentation:

Command line: pydoc3 -b (opens web browser)
Access docstrings: object.**doc**
Browse built-in modules and packages

Best Practices:

Use punctuation marks
Don't repeat obvious information
Don't mix remarks (#) with documentation
Keep documentation concise but clear

üìö WEEK 2: Java Documentation with javadoc
Core Concepts to Master

1. Python to Java Transition
   Key Differences:
   PythonJavaUntyped variablesAll variables must be typedFunctions can exist independentlyEverything must be in a classIndentation for structureCurly braces {} and semicolons ;Documentation after definitionDocumentation before definition
   Basic Java Structure:
   javapublic class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   System.out.println("Hello Java");
   }
   }
2. javadoc Documentation System
   Three Documentation Levels:

Class Level: Documents the entire class
Field Level: Documents class variables
Method Level: Documents individual methods

javadoc Syntax:
java/\*\*

- Brief description of class/method.
-
- Longer description if needed.
-
- @param param Name Description of parameter
- @return Description of return value
- @throws ExceptionType When this exception is thrown
- @author Your Name
- @version 1.0
- @since Week 2 of CSC6301
  \*/
  public class MyClass {
  // implementation
  }
  Common javadoc Tags:

@param - Parameter description
@return - Return value description
@throws - Exception documentation
@author - Author information
@version - Version information
@since - When feature was added

3. Java Coding Guidelines
   Naming Conventions:

Variables/Methods: camelCase (start lowercase)
Classes/Interfaces: CamelCase (start uppercase)
Constants: ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
Packages: lowercase

Code Organization:

Static class variables
Public instance variables
Protected instance variables
Private instance variables
Constructors (fewest parameters first)
Static class methods
Get/Set methods
Other public methods
Protected methods
Private methods

Documentation Requirements:

Every public class must have javadoc
Every public method must have javadoc
First sentence should be concise summary
Don't document bugs or fixes in javadoc

## Java Classes & Inheritance

### Key Concepts

- **Java**: Fundamentalist approach to Object-Oriented programming
- **Everything is an object** except primitive data types and native commands
- **Inheritance**: One of the three pillars of OOP (along with Encapsulation and Polymorphism)

### Inheritance Syntax

```java
// Python style (for comparison)
class Man(Human):
    pass

// Java style
public class Man extends Human {
    // class body
}
```

### Important Points

- **Subclass**: A class that inherits from another class
- **Superclass**: The class being inherited from
- Use `extends` keyword in Java
- Use `super()` to call parent constructor
- **Golden Rule**: Don't reuse code ignoring class meaning

### Study Questions

1. What keyword is used for inheritance in Java?
2. What is the difference between a subclass and superclass?
3. How do you call a parent class constructor in Java?

---

## Polymorphism & Interfaces

### Interface Definition

- **Interface**: Abstract type containing a collection of methods and constant variables
- Used for defining standard methods
- Enables polymorphism - same interface, different implementations

### Interface Syntax

```java
interface Animal {
    public void sound();
}

interface Mammal {
    public void milk();
}

class Dog implements Animal, Mammal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog says: ouf, ouf");
    }

    public void milk() {
        System.out.println("Dog's milk is just for dogs");
    }
}
```

### Key Benefits

- Allows algorithms to work with all classes implementing the interface
- Promotes code reusability
- Enables multiple inheritance of type (not implementation)

### Study Questions

1. What is an interface in Java?
2. How does an interface enable polymorphism?
3. Can a class implement multiple interfaces?

---

## UML Class Diagrams

### What is UML?

- **Unified Modeling Language** - semi-formal, general-purpose modeling language
- Current version: UML 2.0
- Provides standard way to visualize system design

### UML Characteristics

- **Semi-formal**: No automatic code generation from UML
- **Developmental**: Can be changed during application development
- **General-purpose**: Used in any context, environment, language, or platform

### UML Diagram Types

#### Structural Diagrams:

- Class diagram ‚≠ê (most important for OOP)
- Component diagram
- Composite structure diagram
- Deployment diagram
- Object diagram
- Package diagram
- Profile diagram

#### Behavioral Diagrams:

- Activity diagram
- Communication diagram
- Interaction overview diagram
- Sequence diagram
- State diagram
- Timing diagram
- Use case diagram

### Class Diagram Elements

#### Relationships:

- **Association** ‚Üí (static relationship)
- **Inheritance** ‚ñ∑ (subclass-superclass)
- **Realization/Implementation** ‚á†‚á†‚á† (dashed line with triangle)
- **Dependency** ‚á†‚á†‚á† (dashed line with arrow)
- **Aggregation** ‚óá (catalog relationship)
- **Composition** ‚ô¶ (whole-part relationship)

### Study Questions

1. What does UML stand for and what is its purpose?
2. What's the difference between structural and behavioral diagrams?
3. How do you represent inheritance in a UML class diagram?
4. What's the difference between aggregation and composition?

---

## Coding Guidelines

### Modularity and Encapsulation Guidelines

#### Classes Should:

- Have **one single responsibility**
- Depend on **abstractions, not concrete details**
- Have instance variables used by multiple methods OR referenced between multiple calls

#### Access Modifiers (Java):

- **Private**: Only the class (recommended for most data fields)
- **Default** (package-private): Class & package
- **Protected**: Subclass access
- **Public**: No restriction (use sparingly)

**Golden Rule**: Private, maybe Protected, rarely Public!

### Law of Demeter

**Definition**: A module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates.

**Rule**: A method `f` of class `C` should only call methods of:

1. Class C itself
2. An object created by method f
3. An object passed as an argument to method f
4. An object held in an instance variable of class C

**Benefits**:

- Reduces coupling
- Improves maintainability
- Promotes encapsulation

### Objects vs Data Structures

- **Objects**: Hide data, expose behavior through methods
- **Data Structures**: Expose data, have minimal behavior
- **Avoid hybrids** of objects and data structures
- Minimize use of getters/setters
- Keep variables private for flexibility

### Study Questions

1. What is the Law of Demeter?
2. List the four types of objects a method can call methods on.
3. Why should most data fields be private?
4. What's the difference between objects and data structures?

---

## Software Reuse

### Types of Software Reuse

#### By Motivation:

- **Opportunistic**: Realization of existing components
- **Planned**: Strategic design for future reuse

#### By Scope:

- **Internal**: Team/developer reuses own components ‚úÖ
- **External**: Reuse components from others ‚úÖ (with caution)

#### By Integration:

- **Referenced**: Code is referenced (linked) ‚úÖ
- **Forked**: Code is copied ‚ùå (discouraged)

### Best Practices

- **Internal + Planned + Referenced** = Ideal
- **External + Opportunistic + Referenced** = Common and acceptable
- **Forked reuse** = Discouraged (no benefit from updates/patches)
- Always verify external sources are reliable and well-documented

### Composition vs Aggregation

#### Composition

- Object of Class A **contains** object of Class B
- Class B object is **created within** Class A
- When A ceases to exist, B ceases to exist
- **Strong ownership**

```java
class Program {
    private List<Course> courses;

    public void addCourse(String name, List<Student> students) {
        Course c = new Course(name, students); // Created here
        this.courses.add(c);
    }
}
```

#### Aggregation

- Object of Class A **uses** object of Class B
- Class B object is **created outside** Class A
- When A ceases to exist, B continues to exist
- **Weak ownership**

```java
class Course {
    private List<Student> students;

    Course(String name, List<Student> students) {
        this.name = name;
        this.students = students; // Created elsewhere
    }
}
```

### Study Questions

1. What are the three dimensions of software reuse classification?
2. Why is forked reuse discouraged?
3. What's the difference between composition and aggregation?
4. In composition, what happens to the contained object when the container is destroyed?

---

## Java Collections Framework

### Overview

- Part of `java.util` package
- Provides interfaces and basic data structure classes
- Essential for software reuse in Java

### Key Interfaces

#### List Interface

- **LinkedList**: Double-linked list implementation
- **ArrayList**: Dynamic array implementation

##### LinkedList Methods:

```java
LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();
list.addLast(56);           // Add to end
list.addFirst(10);          // Add to beginning
list.removeLast();          // Remove from end
list.removeFirst();         // Remove from beginning
list.get(i);                // Get i-th element
ListIterator<Integer> iter = list.listIterator();
```

#### Queue Interface (FIFO)

```java
Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
q.add("Adams");     // Add to tail
q.remove();         // Remove from head
q.peek();           // View head without removing
```

#### Stack Class (LIFO)

```java
Stack<String> s = new Stack<>();
s.push("Adams");    // Add to top
s.pop();            // Remove from top
s.peek();           // View top without removing
```

#### Map Interface

```java
Map<String, Integer> age = new HashMap<>();  // Hash table
Map<String, Integer> age = new TreeMap<>();  // Red-black tree

age.put("Elizabeth", 96);
age.get("Elizabeth");
age.remove("Elizabeth");
for (String key : age.keySet()) { /* iterate */ }
```

### Study Questions

1. What package contains the Java Collections Framework?
2. What's the difference between Queue and Stack?
3. How do you iterate through a LinkedList?
4. What's the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?

---

## Spring & Hibernate Frameworks

### Spring Framework

- **Created**: 2002, maintained by VMware
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive programming and configuration model for Java enterprise applications
- **Features**:
  - Development environment with project initializer
  - Multiple templates
  - Full framework (virtually impossible to grasp all features)
  - Integration with other frameworks

### Hibernate Framework

- **Created**: 2001, maintained by Red Hat
- **Purpose**: Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework
- **Function**: Data persisting and retrieving from databases
- **Integration**: Works with Spring Framework

### ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

- Provides relational database access in object-oriented environment
- Bridges the gap between objects and relational databases
- Reduces boilerplate database code

### Study Questions

1. What company maintains the Spring Framework?
2. What is the primary purpose of Hibernate?
3. What does ORM stand for and what does it do?
4. How do Spring and Hibernate work together?

---

## SOLID Principles

### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Definition**: "Every software module should have only one reason to change"

- One class = one responsibility
- One method = one responsibility
- Reduces testing complexity
- Improves maintainability

### O - Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

**Definition**: "Software modules should be closed for modifications but open for extensions"

- Extend functionality through inheritance
- Use decorator design patterns
- Avoid modifying existing working code

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Definition**: "Subclasses should be substitutable for base classes"

- Child classes must be able to replace parent classes
- Implement by making base class abstract
- Defer implementation to derived classes

### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Definition**: "Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use"

- Many specific interfaces > one general interface
- Break fat interfaces into multiple smaller ones
- Clients depend only on methods they use

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Definition**: "High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Rather, both should depend upon abstractions"

- Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes
- Use interfaces and abstract classes
- Enables flexibility and testability

### Study Questions

1. What does each letter in SOLID represent?
2. How does SRP reduce testing complexity?
3. What's the difference between "closed for modification" and "open for extension"?
4. Why should high-level modules not depend on low-level modules?

---

## Design Patterns

### What are Design Patterns?

- **Definition**: Reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems
- **Origin**: "Gang of Four" (GoF) book - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"
- **Authors**: Enrich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides
- **Language Independent**: Focus on design, not implementation

### Categories of Design Patterns

#### 1. Creational Patterns (Deal with instantiation)

- **Singleton** ‚≠ê
- Abstract Factory
- Factory Method
- Builder
- Prototype

#### 2. Structural Patterns (Deal with class composition)

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

#### 3. Behavioral Patterns (Deal with object communication)

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

### Singleton Pattern (Detailed)

#### Definition

- **Creational pattern** ensuring only one instance of a class
- Provides global access point to that instance
- Private constructor prevents external instantiation

#### When to Use Singleton

- Database connections
- Configuration management
- GUI components/controllers
- Device managers
- Printing services
- Logging systems

#### Implementation (Double-Checked Locking)

```java
class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton obj = null;

    private Singleton() {} // Private constructor

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (obj == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (obj == null) {
                    obj = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return obj;
    }
}
```

#### Advantages

- Solves name collisions
- Supports eager/lazy initialization
- Thread safety (when properly implemented)
- Reduced memory footprint

#### Disadvantages

- Testing difficulties (global state)
- Concurrency issues (if not properly implemented)
- Limited extensibility
- Global dependency
- Hard to subclass
- Lifecycle management challenges

## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) {#sdlc}

### Core Principle

**"The more effort you spend planning, the fewer patches are required."**

### The 7 Steps of SDLC

#### 1. Planning

- **Purpose**: Calculate time, resources, milestones, and timetables
- **Resources Include**:
  - Platforms (hardware, software, cloud)
  - People (managers, developers, etc.)
- **Detail Level**: Can be detailed or high-level

#### 2. Requirements Definition

- **Purpose**: Establish software modules and expected results
- **Methods**: UML specifications (Use cases, Class diagrams)
- **Also Known As**: Analysis phase
- **Granularity**: Can be coarse or fine-grained

#### 3. Design & Prototyping

- **Purpose**: Fine-grain specification of software
- **Includes**: Architecture, platforms, interfaces, security
- **Prototyping**: Proof of concept, can use different environments

#### 4. Coding

- **Characteristics**:
  - Central step in SDLC
  - Most studied and practiced phase
  - Can be straightforward when other phases are done well
  - Can use multiple programming languages

#### 5. Testing

- **Key Points**:
  - Close to coding phase, often cyclic
  - Different actors should perform coding vs. testing (reduce bias)
  - **Types**: Functional, unit, integration, system, statistical
  - Second most studied SDLC step

#### 6. Deployment

- **Focus**: Management issues rather than development
- **Challenge**: Interface with existing systems
- **Note**: Some authors disregard this step

#### 7. Operations & Maintenance

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Longest phase** in SDLC
  - Includes bug detection and correction
  - Spawns new full or partial cycles
  - Results in patches/new versions
  - Often involves different actors than initial development

---

## SDLC Strategies {#sdlc-strategies}

### Traditional Approaches

#### Waterfall

- **Characteristics**: Sequential, step-by-step advancement
- **Pros**: Simple, straightforward
- **Cons**: Not flexible, poor for evolving requirements
- **Best For**: Well-defined, stable requirements

#### V-Model

- **Characteristics**: Waterfall variation with testing after each step
- **Testing**: Verifications/validations throughout process
- **Advantage**: Early error detection

### Flexible Approaches

#### Iterative

- **Characteristics**: System refined at each step
- **Opposite**: Waterfall approach
- **Advantage**: Can adapt to changing requirements

#### Incremental

- **Characteristics**: Some system parts unknown initially
- **Relationship**: Variation of iterative strategy
- **Advantage**: Can develop known parts while discovering others

#### Spiral

- **Characteristics**: Cyclical application of all phases
- **Includes**: Full replanning, requirements redefinition
- **Advantage**: Most flexible strategy

### Modern Approaches

#### Lean

- **Philosophy**: "Don't do today what can be done tomorrow"
- **Focus**: Reduce overhead
- **Trade-off**: May sacrifice documentation

#### Agile

- **Characteristics**: Iterative + incremental combination
- **Philosophy**: Encourages early mistakes/errors
- **Popularity**: Compromise between Waterfall and DevOps

#### DevOps

- **Characteristics**: Agile + Lean combination
- **Approach**: Planning often forsaken
- **Risk**: May be too wild for reliable code

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy  | Flexibility | Documentation | Speed     | Reliability |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Waterfall | Low         | High          | Low       | High        |
| V-Model   | Low         | High          | Low       | High        |
| Iterative | Medium      | Medium        | Medium    | Medium      |
| Spiral    | High        | Medium        | Medium    | Medium      |
| Agile     | High        | Low           | High      | Medium      |
| DevOps    | Very High   | Very Low      | Very High | Low         |

## Design Patterns {#design-patterns}

### Three Categories of Design Patterns

#### 1. Creational Patterns (Deal with Instantiation)

- **Singleton**: Ensures single instance
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of objects
- **Factory**: Creates objects without specifying exact class
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning existing instances

#### 2. Structural Patterns (Deal with Class Composition)

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionality to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
- **Flyweight**: Shares objects efficiently
- **Proxy**: Provides placeholder/surrogate for another object

#### 3. Behavioral Patterns (Deal with Object Communication)

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along handler chain
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects
- **Interpreter**: Defines grammar representation
- **Iterator**: Provides way to access elements sequentially
- **Mediator**: Defines object interaction
- **Memento**: Captures and restores object state
- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects of state changes
- **State**: Changes object behavior when internal state changes
- **Visitor**: Defines new operations without changing classes

---

## Detailed Pattern Examples

### Decorator Pattern (Structural)

#### Purpose

Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting other objects from the same class.

#### Key Components

1. **Component Interface**: Defines common interface (e.g., Coffee)
2. **ConcreteComponent**: Basic implementation (e.g., SimpleCoffee)
3. **Decorator Class**: Abstract wrapper class (e.g., CoffeeDecorator)
4. **ConcreteDecorators**: Specific decorators (e.g., MilkDecorator, SugarDecorator)

#### Implementation Steps

```java
// 1. Component Interface
interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}

// 2. Concrete Component
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    public String getDescription() { return "Simple coffee"; }
    public double getCost() { return 5.0; }
}

// 3. Decorator Class
class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee decoratedCoffee;
    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) { this.decoratedCoffee = coffee; }
    public String getDescription() { return decoratedCoffee.getDescription(); }
    public double getCost() { return decoratedCoffee.getCost(); }
}

// 4. Concrete Decorators
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) { super(coffee); }
    public String getDescription() { return decoratedCoffee.getDescription() + ", milk"; }
    public double getCost() { return decoratedCoffee.getCost() + 1.5; }
}
```

### Observer Pattern (Behavioral)

#### Purpose

Notifies multiple objects of state changes to keep them synchronized.

#### Key Components

1. **Observer Interface**: Defines update method
2. **Subject Class**: Maintains observer list, notifies changes
3. **ConcreteObserver**: Implements specific update behavior
4. **Client**: Demonstrates pattern usage

#### Use Cases

- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Event management systems
- GUI event handling

### State Pattern (Behavioral)

#### Purpose

Allows object to change behavior when internal state changes.

#### Example: Traffic Light System

- **States**: Red, Yellow, Green
- **Transitions**: Each state defines next state
- **Context**: TrafficLightContext manages current state

- Explain the importance of environments and compatibility
- Use version control systems effectively
- Implement issue tracking in collaborative projects
- Create and run unit tests in Java
- Perform static code analysis
- Implement the Observer design pattern

---

## üìñ Key Concepts

### 1. Version Control Systems

#### **Version Numbering Convention**

- **Format**: M.N.b (Major.Minor.Build)
  - **M (Major)**: Significant changes, new features, breaking changes
  - **N (Minor)**: Small improvements, bug fixes, backward compatible
  - **b (Build/Patch)**: Bug fixes, patches, hotfixes

**Examples:**

- macOS Monterey 12.0.1
- Windows 11 (Build 21996.1)
- Python 3.10.7
- Java SE 19 Platform JSR 394

#### **Key Principles**

- Version control manages source code revisions
- Not all revisions become public software versions
- Can also manage documentation versions
- Structure follows DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with trunk, branches, and merges

### 2. Environments and Compatibility

#### **Why Version Management Matters**

- **Familiarity**: Previous experience with specific versions
- **Documentation**: Better documentation for certain versions
- **Compatibility**: Different versions have different characteristics

#### **Development Environment**

- Must track version numbers of ALL packages used
- Your software depends on specific versions used during build
- Some environments encapsulate package versions automatically

#### **Python Example with pip**

```bash
pip -r install requirements.txt
```

**Sample requirements.txt:**

```
absl-py==0.13.0
astor==0.8.1
cachetools==4.2.2
certifi==2021.5.30
numpy==1.18.5
```

### 3. Version Documentation

- Changes from previous version
- Requirements changes
- New and deprecated features
- Bugs addressed

#### **Code Revision Documentation**

Must state:

- Target audience (public, developers, testers, beta testers)
- Implementation issues
- All full version documentation items

### 4. Issue Tracking Systems

#### **Evolution: Bug Tracker ‚Üí Issue Tracker**

- Originally tracked software bugs for maintenance
- Evolved to handle all types of issues, not just bugs
- Used in collaborative projects for discussion and resolution

#### **Issue Resolution Approaches**

- Fixing the bug
- Finding ways to avoid the issue
- Documenting the issue
- Collecting data about the issue

#### **Two Main Approaches**

**1. Issue Tracking Practices** (GitHub-style)

- Blog-like entries in repositories
- Effective for open software
- Ad hoc procedure
- Community-driven

**2. Issue Tracking Tools** (Centralized)

- Specialized software systems
- Controlled approach
- Systematic registry
- Used across SDLC phases (coding, testing, maintenance)

### 5. GitHub Repository

#### **Key Statistics**

- 83 million developers
- 200 million repositories (28 million public)
- Acquired by Microsoft in 2018
- Free registration required to store (not to download)

#### **Features**

- Version control
- Issue tracking
- Documentation standardization
- Collaborative development

## Testing

### Testing Philosophy

> "One eye could be as good as two, but four eyes are always better than two."

### Purpose

- Detect problems overlooked by the coder
- Industries often use separate teams for coding and testing
- Verify absence of faults across all combinations of initial states and usage cases

### Testing Classifications

#### By Method (How Testing is Done)

##### 1. Passive Testing

- Analyzes logs and traces of system execution
- No direct interaction with code
- **Use case**: Post-mortem analysis, monitoring

##### 2. Active Testing

- **Static Testing**:
  - Observing code without running it
  - "Proofreading the code"
  - Less common in industrial environments
- **Dynamic Testing**:
  - Executing code with or without debugger
  - Similar to debugging itself
  - Often considered redundant

#### By Awareness (What Tester Knows)

##### 1. Transparent-Box Testing (White-Box)

- **Also known as**: Clear box, glass box, structural testing
- **Tester knows**: Actual code implementation
- **Focus**: Internal structure and logic
- **Common use**: Unit testing
- **Techniques**: Code coverage analysis, path testing

##### 2. Black-Box Testing

- **Also known as**: Opaque-box, component interface, functional testing
- **Tester knows**: Only functionality, not implementation
- **Focus**: Input-output behavior
- **Common use**: System and acceptance testing

##### 3. Grey-Box Testing

- **Combination**: Tester knows implementation but tests functionality
- **Middle ground**: Structural knowledge + functional testing
- **Use case**: Integration testing

#### By Depth Level (Scope of Testing)

##### 1. Unit Testing

- **Target**: Specific code sections (functions, methods, classes)
- **Approach**: Usually transparent-box
- **Goal**: Verify individual components work correctly
- **Characteristics**: Isolated, fast, automated

##### 2. Integration Testing

- **Target**: Software interfaces between tested units
- **Approach**: Usually black-box
- **Goal**: Verify components work together
- **Types**: Big bang, incremental, sandwich

##### 3. System Testing

- **Target**: Complete integrated system
- **Scope**: End-to-end functionality
- **Environment**: Production-like conditions
- **Focus**: Requirements compliance

##### 4. Acceptance Testing

Different types based on goals:

- **User Acceptance**: Comply with user requirements
- **Operational Acceptance**: Verify overall functioning
- **Contractual/Regulatory**: Legal compliance
- **Alpha/Beta Tests**: Initial deployment testing

---

## Code Profiling

### Purpose

- Assess code efficiency (speed, memory, resources)
- Software profiling tools act as "x-ray of software system"
- Usually performed during coding phase and maintenance

### Types of Profiling

#### 1. Time Flat-Profiler

- Measures time spent in each code portion
- Identifies performance bottlenecks
- Shows function execution times

#### 2. Space Flat-Profiler

- Analyzes memory usage
- Tracks memory allocation and deallocation
- Identifies memory leaks

#### 3. Call-Chain Profiler

- Maps actual function calling graph
- Shows call relationships and frequencies
- Helps understand program flow

### Profiling Approaches

#### 1. User Programmed Profiling

- **Method**: Insert profiling code into system
- **Example**: Commands for memory usage and time snapshots
- **Pros**: Full control, specific measurements
- **Cons**: Code modification required

#### 2. Package Supported Profiling

- **Method**: Import profiling libraries
- **Example**: Python's cProfile package
- **Pros**: Easy integration, standard metrics
- **Cons**: Limited customization

#### 3. Dedicated Profiling Tools

- **Method**: External tools that attach to program
- **Example**: DataDog profiler
- **Pros**: Comprehensive analysis, no code changes
- **Cons**: May require setup, potential overhead

### Profiler Limitations

#### Event vs Statistical Profilers

##### Event Profilers

- **Method**: Collect measures at key execution points
- **Problem**: Must stop observed system to run profiler
- **Result**: Imprecise measurements due to interference

##### Statistical Profilers

- **Method**: Periodic sampling instead of event-based
- **Trade-off**: Sacrifice fine-grain precision for overall accuracy
- **Benefit**: Less interference with observed system

#### Common Issues

- Profiler runs simultaneously with observed system
- Operating system processes cause interference
- Difficulty getting exact time measurements
- Overhead from profiler itself affects results

---

## State Design Pattern

### Definition

Design pattern that allows object to change behavior when internal state changes. Used to manage state transitions without complex conditional logic.

### Components

#### 1. State Interface

- Defines common interface for all concrete states
- Contains methods that vary by state

#### 2. Concrete States

- Implement State interface
- Define behavior specific to each state
- Handle state transitions

#### 3. Context Class

- Maintains reference to current state
- Delegates behavior to current state object
- Provides methods to change state

### Real-World Examples

#### 1. Video Player

- **States**: Play, Pause, Stop
- **Transitions**: Play‚ÜíPause, Pause‚ÜíPlay, any‚ÜíStop

#### 2. Vending Machine

- **States**: Waiting for Money, Has Money, Dispensing
- **Flow**: Wait‚ÜíInsert Money‚ÜíSelect Product‚ÜíDispense‚ÜíWait

#### 3. ATM Machine

- **States**: Idle, Card Inserted, PIN Entered, Transaction, End
- **Security**: Each state controls allowed operations

#### 4. Document Workflow

- **States**: Draft, Review, Approved
- **Permissions**: Different editing rights per state

#### 5. TCP Connection

- **States**: Established, Listening, Closed
- **Protocol**: Network communication states

        for j in range(0, len(a)-i-1):
            if a[j] > a[j+1]:
                a[j+1], a[j] = a[j], a[j+1]

        # Invariant test - why is this needed?
        for k in range(len(a)-1, len(a)-(i+2), -1):
            if (k == 0):  # Why this test?
                break
            if (a[k] < a[k-1]):
                print("Error at i =", i)
                break
```

## Design Patterns

### Three Categories of Design Patterns

#### 1. Creational Patterns

**Purpose**: Deal with object instantiation

**Examples**:

- **Singleton**: Ensures only one instance of a class
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects
- **Factory**: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning existing instances

#### 2. Structural Patterns

**Purpose**: Deal with class composition to add new functionality

**Examples**:

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
- **Flyweight**: Reduces memory usage through object sharing
- **Proxy**: Provides placeholder/surrogate for another object

#### 3. Behavioral Patterns

**Purpose**: Deal with object communication and responsibilities

**Examples**:

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along handler chain
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects
- **Interpreter**: Defines grammar for language interpretation
- **Iterator**: Provides way to access collection elements
- **Mediator**: Defines how objects interact
- **Memento**: Captures and restores object state
- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects of state changes
- **State**: Allows object to alter behavior when state changes
- **Visitor**: Defines new operations without changing classes

---

## SOLID Principles

### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change
- **Goal**: Each class should have only one job/responsibility

### O - Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

- **Definition**: Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification
- **Goal**: Add new functionality without changing existing code

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- **Definition**: Child class must be substitutable for its parent class
- **Goal**: Ensure inheritance relationships work correctly
- **Key**: Child class can assume parent's place without errors

### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- **Definition**: Interface should be as small as possible in terms of cohesion
- **Goal**: Interfaces should do ONE thing
- **Benefit**: Clients shouldn't depend on methods they don't use

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- **Definition**:
  - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
  - Both should depend on abstractions
  - Abstractions should not depend on details
  - Details should depend on abstractions

---

## Code Quality & Testing

### Access Modifiers (Java)

**Guideline**: "Private, maybe Protected, rarely Public!"

#### Access Levels

- **Private**: Only the class itself
- **Default**: Class & package
- **Protected**: Subclass access too
- **Public**: No restrictions

#### Best Practices

- **Data Fields**: Almost always private (except constants)
- **Public Methods**: Only when intended for external use
- **Private Methods**: Used only within associated class

### Unit Testing & Code Coverage

#### Testing Goals

- **Basic Functionality**: Test arithmetic operations
- **Edge Cases**: Test division by zero, boundary conditions
- **Coverage**: Aim for 100% code coverage
- **Automation**: Implement automated testing

#### Code Analysis Tools

- **Linters**: Check coding standards and style
- **Static Analysis**: Find potential bugs and issues
- **Coverage Tools**: Measure test coverage

### Linter Analysis Example Issues

1. **Missing Javadoc Comments**: Classes and methods need documentation
2. **Magic Numbers**: Use named constants instead of hard-coded values
3. **Variable Naming**: Use descriptive variable names
4. **Braces**: Use braces for all loops and conditionals
5. **Indentation**: Maintain consistent formatting

---

## UML Diagrams

### UML 2.0 - Unified Modeling Language

#### Structural Diagrams

- **Class Diagram**: Shows classes and relationships (most important for OO)
- **Component Diagram**: Shows component organization
- **Composite Structure Diagram**: Shows internal structure
- **Deployment Diagram**: Shows hardware/software mapping
- **Object Diagram**: Shows object instances
- **Package Diagram**: Shows package dependencies
- **Profile Diagram**: Shows UML extensions

#### Behavioral Diagrams

- **Activity Diagram**: Shows workflow/business processes
- **Communication Diagram**: Shows object interactions
- **Interaction Overview Diagram**: Shows interaction sequences
- **Sequence Diagram**: Shows message exchanges over time
- **State Diagram**: Shows state transitions
- **Timing Diagram**: Shows timing constraints
- **Use Case Diagram**: Shows system functionality

**Key Point**: For OO systems, the Class Diagram is often the most important design document.
