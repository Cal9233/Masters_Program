# CSC 6304 Week 6 - Developing native mobile applications

## Overview

**Course:** CSC 6304 - Advanced Programming Concepts  
**Professor:** Rob Sand  
**Topic:** Developing native mobile applications

## Evolution of Devices
- **Computer Devices**: 60s–70s → 80s–90s → 2000s+
- **Phone Devices**: 60s–70s → 80s–90s → 2000s+
- **Music Devices**: 60s–70s → 80s–90s → 2000s+

### Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns
- Technology follows an exponential growth pattern.
- Computing power doubles every 18–24 months.
- Size and cost are halved at a similar rate.

---

## The Future of Devices
- **Wearable Technology**:
  - Watches with smart functions
  - Smart rings
  - Microscopic robots
  - Smart glasses (record & upload)
  - Brain chips

---

## Singularity & Steve Jobs’ Vow
- Jobs emphasized control over both hardware and software.
- Avoid business models with external dependency.

---

## Mobile Development Approaches
### Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Works offline
- Cross-device via browsers

### Native Development
- Built with native SDK or language
- Direct hardware access
- Enhanced security

---

## Why Native Mobile Apps?
- **Performance Benefits**: Optimized for platform hardware & APIs.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Platform-specific UI/UX (Material Design, HIG).
- **Device Feature Access**: Camera, GPS, Bluetooth, push notifications, sensors.
- **Security Advantages**: Stronger encryption and authentication.
- **App Store Presence**: Visibility, credibility, distribution.
- **Monetization Options**: In-app purchases, subscriptions, paid apps.

## Native Platforms

### iOS Development
- **IDE**: Xcode (macOS only)
- **Languages**: Swift (modern), Objective-C (legacy)
- **UI Frameworks**: UIKit (imperative), SwiftUI (declarative)
- **Setup**:
  - Install Xcode and simulators
  - Connect to GitHub
  - Use Previews for testing
- **Submission**:
  - Prepare app for App Store distribution

### Android Development
- **IDE**: Android Studio (cross-platform)
- **Languages**: Kotlin (modern), Java (legacy)
- **UI Frameworks**: XML layouts, Jetpack Compose (declarative)
- **Setup**:
  - Install Android Studio
  - Configure emulator
  - Connect to GitHub
- **Publishing**:
  - Upload to Google Play Store

---

## Project #6 Instructions
1. Create new project in **Xcode** (SwiftUI tutorial) or **Android Studio** (Getting Started tutorial).
2. Make frequent Git commits.
3. Connect project to Week 6 GitLab repo and push code.
4. Record a demo video (Loom/QuickTime).
5. **Extra Credit**: Add Google Maps SDK + Weather API (reuse Week 5 project).
