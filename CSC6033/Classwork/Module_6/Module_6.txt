### Chomsky Hierachy

# Regular languages - Finite State Automata
- 
- type 3 language
- a*b*

# Context - free languages - Push Down Automata
- type 2 language
- a^nb^n

# Context - sensitive languages - Linear Bounded Automata
- type 1 language
- a^nb^nc^n (counting a's and b's with a stack, but how can we track the number of c's?)

# Recurively enumerable languages - Turing Machines
- type 0 language
- (a|b|c)* with #a = #b and < #c (it has to count a's, b's and c's all the way until the end of the word, 
and only then check it out these numbers)

Alan Turing defined a theoretical machine, called "a-machine", as for automatic machine, then later changed to
"Turing Machine (TM)".

A TM is a theoretical model of computation that manipulates symbols on a tape according to a set of rules.

A TM consist of:
- A tape divided into cells, one next to the other
- A head that can read and write sumbols on the tape and move the tape left and right one cell at a time
- A state transition table, given the current state of the machine and the symbol under the head, may the 
machine to:
    - Either erase or write a symbol in the tape cell under the head
    - Move the head one cell left or one cell right
    - Move from the current state to another one
