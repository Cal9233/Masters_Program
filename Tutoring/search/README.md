On Friday, you left the office for a long weekend. When you left, the system was working great!

However, when you returned to the office on Tuesday, the system had crashed! The error log was full of thousands of error messages!

It is up to you to discover what happened. Searching the entire log beginning to end would take far too long, so you need to design an algorithm to search the log in a more efficient manner.

Your algorithm must find the last entry to occur before the errors begin.

Implement the function `findStartOfErrors` in `program.py`.
