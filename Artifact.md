## Tips for Algorithm Selection

1. **Consider the constraints**:
   - Input size
   - Time/space requirements
   - Is input sorted?
   - Frequency of operations

2. **Common problem patterns**:
   - Two pointers: Array/string problems
   - Sliding window: Subarrays/substring problems
   - Binary search: Sorted array problems
   - BFS: Shortest path, level-order
   - DFS: Exhaustive search, backtracking
   - Dynamic programming: Optimization problems

3. **Performance considerations**:
   - Choose based on:
     - Expected input size
     - Required operation frequencies
     - Memory constraints
     - Need for stability
